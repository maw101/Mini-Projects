* [Happy Numbers](src/HappyNumbers.java) - an application that displays the first N happy numbers.
* [Fibonacci with Recursion](src/FibonacciWithRecursion.java) - an application that displays the nth Fibonacci number calculated through use of recursion.
* [Fibonacci from the last two Fibonacci Numbers](src/FibonacciFromLastTwoFibNumbers.java) - an application that displays the nth Fibonacci number calculated through use of the previous two Fibonacci numbers.
* [Fibonacci Number from Binets Formula](src/FibonacciWithBinetsFormula.java) - an application that displays the nth Fibonacci number calculated through use of Binet's formula.
* [Mortgage Calculator](src/MortgageCalculator.java) - an application that calculates both a fixed monthly payment amount or the remaining loan balance for a mortgage.
* [Simple Tax Calculator](src/SimpleTaxCalculator.java) - an application that calculates a final cost by adding a percentage of tax to the untaxed cost
* [Cost to Cover Floor](src/CostToCoverFloor.java) - an application that calculates the number of tiles required to cover a room given both the rooms dimensions and the tiles dimensions. The application also calcualtes the cost for flooring given room and tile dimensions along with the cost per tile.
* [Submerged Balls in Water Tank](src/SubmergedBallsInWaterTank.java) - an application that determines if a water tank overflows given a number of balls are submerged in it
* [Sierpinski Triangle](src/SierpinskiTriangle.java) - an application that outputs a Sierpinski Triangle of a given order

---------
* [Reverse String](src/ReverseString.java) - an application that provides a reversed version of the string input.
* [Fizz Buzz Test](src/FizzBuzzTest.java) - an application that displays the result of the fizz buzz test to the standard output for numbers 1 through 100.
* [Number Word Equivalent](src/NumberWordEquivalent.java) - an application that provides a formatted word equivalent of a given integer n.
* [Palindrome](src/Palindrome.java) - an application that displays whether a given string is a palindrome.
* [Count Vowels](src/CountVowels.java) - an application that displays the total number of vowels in a string along with counts for each individual vowel.
* [Count Words in a String](src/CountWordsInString.java) - an application that displays the total number of words in a string.

Classic Algorithms
---------
* [Collatz Conjecture](src/CollatzConjecture.java) - an application that provides a simulation of the Collatz Conjecture given a valid starting integer.
* [One Hundred Doors](src/OneHundredDoors.java) - an application that displays the 100 doors problem. 100 doors in a row are initially closed. 100 passes made by the doors. First time through, each door visited and the door is toggled (i.e. closed if open, opened if closed). Second time through, only visit every 2nd door. Third time only visit every 3rd door. Etc until reaching the 100th door.
* [Return Change](src/ReturnChange.java) - an application that displays the break down of change in coins and notes when given an amount in pence.
